# Exercise 1 : Use Data From A Form
# Create a form like the one below:


# Using the state to store the value of the inputs, you will :
# send the form data as an object to the state
# display the data in the console
# display a success message on the page


# Exercise 2 : Display The User Input From A Form With React


# Use the state to store the value of the inputs: first name, last name, phone, and email - you should make sure the inputs are correct before the submission.

# When the form is submitted the form data should be displayed on the page, and the form should “disappear”. You can do this by calling a function (use a ternary operator that displays either the form, or the user’s data).

# Add a reset button to reset all the values and display the form back.
