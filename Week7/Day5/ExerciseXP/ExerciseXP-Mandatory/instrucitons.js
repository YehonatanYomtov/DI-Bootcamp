// 🌟 Exercise 1: Building A RESTful API
// Instructions
// You’re tasked with building a RESTful API for a blog platform.
// Users should be able to create, read, update, and delete blog posts using different endpoints.

// 1) Create a directory named blog-api.

// 2) Inside the blog-api directory, open a terminal and run npm init to initialize a new Node.js project. Follow the prompts to set up your project.

// 3) Install the express package by running npm install express in the terminal.

// 4) Create a file named server.js.

// 5) In server.js, require the express package and set up an Express app.

// 6) Create a data array to simulate a database. Each item in the array should represent a blog post with properties like id, title, and content.

// 7) Implement the following routes using Express:
// 8) GET /posts: Return a list of all blog posts.
// 9) GET /posts/:id: Return a specific blog post based on its id.
// 10) POST /posts: Create a new blog post.
// 11) PUT /posts/:id: Update an existing blog post.
// 12) DELETE /posts/:id: Delete a blog post.

// 13) Implement error handling for invalid routes and server errors.

// 14) Start the Express app and listen on a specified port (e.g., 3000).

// 🌟 Exercise 2: Building A Basic CRUD API With Express.Js
// Instructions
// In this exercise, you’ll build a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API using Express.js. Your task is to create routes to manage a collection of books.

// 1) Create a new directory named book-api.

// 2) Inside the book-api directory, initialize a new Node.js project and install the express package.

// 3) Create a new file named app.js in the book-api directory.

// 4) In app.js, import the express module and create an instance of an Express app.

// 5) Define a basic data array containing a few book objects. Each book object should have properties like id, title, author, and publishedYear.

// 6) Set up the app to listen on port 5000. Print a message in the console to indicate that the server is running.

// 7) Implement the “Read all” route by defining a route at GET /api/books. Send a JSON response with the books array.

// 8) Implement the “Read” route by defining a route at GET /api/books/:bookId. Extract the bookId parameter from the URL and use it to find the corresponding book in the books array. If the book is found, send a JSON response with the book details and a status code of 200 (OK). If the book is not found, send a 404 status with a “Book not found” message.

// 9) Implement the “Create” route at POST /api/books. Use the express.json() middleware to parse JSON body content. Inside the route handler, create a new book object with an incremented ID and the data from the request body. Add the new book to the books array and return a JSON response with the new book and a status code of 201 (Created).

// 🌟 Exercise 3: Building A Basic CRUD API With Express And Axios Using A Data Module
// Instructions
// In this exercise, you’ll build a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API using Express.js and Axios to retrieve data from the JSONPlaceholder API and respond with that data in your own API. You’ll also create a separate module to handle data retrieval using Axios.

// ---- Part 1: Setting Up the Express Server

// 1) Create a new directory named crud-api.

// 2) Inside the crud-api directory, initialize a new Node.js project and install the express and axios packages.

// 3) Create a new file named app.js in the crud-api directory.

// 4) In app.js, import the express module and create an instance of an Express app.

// 5) Set up the app to listen on port 5000. Print a message in the console to indicate that the server is running.

// ---- Part 2: Creating a Data Module for Axios

// 1) Inside the crud-api directory, create a new directory named data.

// 2) Inside the data directory, create a new file named dataService.js.

// 3) In dataService.js, import the axios module and create a function named fetchPosts that makes a GET request to the JSONPlaceholder API to fetch data for all posts.

// 4) Export the fetchPosts function.

// ---- Part 3: Using the Data Module in the Express App

// 1) Inside app.js, import the dataService module you created.

// 2) Create an endpoint in your Express app that uses the fetchPosts function from the dataService module to retrieve data from the JSONPlaceholder API.

// 3) Respond with the fetched data from the JSONPlaceholder API. https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts

// 4) Print a message in the console to indicate that the data has been successfully retrieved and sent as a response.
